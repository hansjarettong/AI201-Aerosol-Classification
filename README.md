This repository consists of four (5) Jupyter notebooks that form a pipeline from data processing to analysis of results. These contain the necessary code to generate the data and results used for the paper. The notebooks in order are as follows:

- `00-Data Preparation.ipynb`
- `01-Model Fitting.ipynb`
- `02-Performance Metrics.ipynb`
- `03-Temporal Analysis.ipynb`
- `04-Analysis of Results.ipynb`

Results are also exported to the appropriate directories in this repository. Note that re-running the notebooks would overwrite the files in these directories.

- `figures/` - contains plots and figures in PNG form
- `models/` - contains the trained models saved as Pickle files 
- `tables/` - contains tables in CSV form, such as performance metrics and the appended test data
